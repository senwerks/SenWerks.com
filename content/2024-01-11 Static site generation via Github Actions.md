Summary: A rundown on how I built my self-hosted static website using a python-based static site generator that is automatically triggered via Github Actions when new posts are committed.

I wanted to try and replicate something similar to Github Pages, but self-hosted. My goals were for the website itself to be hosted on my own servers, but still be able to commit the post content itself to a Git repository. I feel like this is the best of both worlds, having the content in Git but the actual website hosted in a place I control, where I can do whatever I want with the rest of the site and I'm not restricted by the limitations of Github Pages.

So far all of this is me learning-as-I-go, so I will update this post along the way and use it as my own notes as well as a way to share with anyone else interested in doing something similar.
